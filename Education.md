# Education
I am a freshman here at Mizzou and I am working towards my bachelor's degree in Information Technology. I was previously a Secondary Education major but I decided to switch at semester. I went to Lindbergh High School in St. Louis. I decided to come to Mizzou because I love the town and the vibrant community here!
