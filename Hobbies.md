# My Hobbies
Some of my hobbies include hiking, reading, watching sitcoms, and going to coffee shops! My favorite book is _Shades of Lovers_ by Catarine Hancock. My favorite sitcoms are _New Girl_ and _Parks and Rec_. My favorite hiking trail is Castlewood State Park in St. Louis. My favorite coffee shop is Lakota here in Columbia!
